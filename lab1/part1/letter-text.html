        <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances...</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC...</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders develope</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance </dt>   
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>  
            
            <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page</p>
